For future reference: demon.py reads the manga site and notifies the user through telegram bot, if the given manga title is updated with new chapter.
This script reads the magasite using selenium and is very slow. So A new script that uses 'HTTP_parsing_Asynchronous-Fetching' is used.
This is automated using the .yml in the workflow folder.
